# Formal Language and DFA in Kotlin

## 1. Introduction

This document provides the steps and explanations to implement a formal language using a regular grammar and a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) in Kotlin. The grammar is defined, and then a DFA is constructed to validate whether the words generated by the grammar are accepted.

## 2. Regular Grammar Definition

A regular grammar consists of:

- **VN** - Set of non-terminal symbols
- **VT** - Set of terminal symbols
- **P** - Set of production rules
- **S** - Start symbol

### Grammar:

- **VN = {S, L, D}** (Non-terminal symbols)
- **VT = {a, b, c, d, e, f, j}** (Terminal symbols)

### Production Rules:

1. **S → aS**
2. **S → bS**
3. **S → cD**
4. **S → dL**
5. **S → e**
6. **L → eL**
7. **L → fL**
8. **L → jD**
9. **L → e**
10. **D → eD**
11. **D → d**

## 3. DFA Construction

A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) is defined by:

- **Q** - Set of states
- **Σ** - Input alphabet
- **δ** - Transition function
- **q0** - Start state
- **F** - Final states

### DFA Transition Rules:

- **Q = {q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5}**
- **Σ = {a, b, c, d, e, f, j}**
- **Transition Function (δ)**:
    - δ(q0, 'a') = q1
    - Variant 4:
    - VN={S, L, D},
    - VT={a, b, c, d, e, f, j},
    - P={
    - S → aS
    - S → bS
    - S → cD
    - S → dL
    - S → e
    - L → eL
    - L → fL
    - L → jD
    - L → e
    - D → eD
    - D → d
    - }

### Start State: **q0**

### Final States: **{q5}**

## 4. Steps for Implementation

### 4.1. Define States and Transitions
- Create a set of states for the DFA: **{q0, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5}**.
- Define the alphabet: **{a, b, c, d, e, f, j}**.
- Implement the transition function that defines how the DFA moves from one state to another based on the input symbol.

### 4.2. Define the DFA Logic
- Implement a function to simulate the DFA. This function will:
  - Take an input string.
  - Process each symbol in the string.
  - Transition between states according to the defined transition function.
  - Determine if the final state is an accepting state (i.e., q5).

### 4.3. Test with Words
Test the DFA with a set of input words:
- Word 1: "aabb" → Expected Result: **Rejected**
- Word 2: "cd" → Expected Result: **Rejected**
- Word 3: "ce" → Expected Result: **Accepted**
- Word 4: "fjd" → Expected Result: **Rejected**
- Word 5: "eef" → Expected Result: **Rejected**

## 5. Conclusion

This guide outlines the construction of a DFA for a regular grammar in Kotlin. The DFA processes strings generated by the grammar and validates whether they belong to the language defined by the grammar.

The approach can be extended by adding additional features, such as converting the grammar into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) or supporting more complex grammars. This implementation provides a foundation for working with regular languages in Kotlin.
